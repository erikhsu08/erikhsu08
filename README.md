## **About me**
I am a Computer Science student, currently 19 years old, and in my 4th semester. My passion for Android development is ever-growing, and I have been dedicated to honing my skills in this area.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have had the opportunity to delve into a variety of subjects, including Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, Software Design, and Mathematical Modeling, among other mathematical areas. My experience includes introductory work with Python, C, Java, and Assembly, and I am focusing my efforts on deepening my knowledge in Java for Android development, with plans to learn Kotlin in the future.

My goal is to create impactful applications that improve people's quality of life and help communities in need. I participated in a hackathon organized by the UNODC, where we achieved 2nd place, an experience that allowed me to develop my creativity, teamwork skills, and problem-solving abilities, as well as the ability to contribute to real-world problem-solving.

I am always open to constructive criticism, as I believe it is crucial for my personal and professional growth. My thirst for knowledge is relentless, and I view mistakes as learning opportunities.

In addition to Portuguese, which is my native language, I have intermediate proficiency in both English and Mandarin.
