## **👨🏻‍💻 About me**
I am a Computer Science student, currently 19 years old, and in my 5th semester. My passion for Android development is ever-growing, and I have been dedicated to honing my skills in this area.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have had the opportunity to delve into a variety of subjects, including Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis, Software Design, and Mathematical Modeling, among other mathematical areas. My experience includes introductory work with Python, C, Java, and Assembly, and I am focusing my efforts on deepening my knowledge in Kotlin for Android development.

My goal is to create impactful applications that improve people's quality of life and help communities in need. I participated in a hackathon organized by the UNODC, where we achieved 2nd place, an experience that allowed me to develop my creativity, teamwork skills, and problem-solving abilities, as well as the ability to contribute to real-world problem-solving.

I am always open to constructive criticism, as I believe it is crucial for my personal and professional growth. My thirst for knowledge is relentless, and I view mistakes as learning opportunities.

In addition to Portuguese, which is my native language, I have intermediate proficiency in both English and Mandarin.
